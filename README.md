# Scribe! - HTML editor
By Jan

## About
Scribe! is a free, source code-based HTML editor written in C++ that makes it possible to create sophisticated Internet pages quickly and easily. Scribe! is equally suitable for beginners who want to learn HTML, as well as for professionals who want to make their work easier while still maintaining full control over the source code. Extensions such as Cascading Style-Sheets and JavaScripts are also included in Scribe! Scribe! provides many features and tools related to HTML and the Internet.

Scribe! was my first big software project, which I programmed at the age of 19. Even though I didn't know what usability was at all at that time, relevant magazines emphasized the simple and logical usability of the program. And also the users (among them many schools) were enthusiastic about the beginner friendliness and downloaded Scribe! 2 more than 150.000 times over the years.

Support for the program has been discontinued.
